What is the anticipated growth in the private space flight market given the recent success of companies like SpaceX with their recent succesful launch of Inspiration4? Does space exploration have a viable business model in the next 5 years?

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — A SpaceX rocket lifted off on Wednesday night from a launchpad here, carrying four Americans on an adventure to orbit the Earth for three days that will be like no other.

None of the crew works for NASA. The mission, known as Inspiration4, is the first orbital trip where not one of the people aboard is a professional astronaut and where government is, by and large, a bystander and observer.

The evening sky was nearly devoid of clouds when the nine engines of the Falcon 9 rocket ignited, lifting the rocket and its passengers to space.

#### Step 1:

The Inspiration4 mission, which launched on Wednesday, shows how medical researchers can benefit from the new commercial space travel. The crew of four, none of whom is a professional astronaut, will spend a fair amount of time in orbit helping to advance medical research.

One of the passengers, Hayley Arceneaux, exemplifies those possibilities. At 29, she is younger than most space travelers, a cancer survivor and will be the first person in space with a prosthesis — metal rods that were implanted after a tumor was removed from her left leg.

#### Step 2: What if we then add?
Research to date has revealed that fluids shift upward in the body in the absence of gravity — swollen heads, shrunken legs. The lack of gravity also weakens bones. Not only does radiation in space slam into DNA creating mutations, but the unusual conditions of weightlessness cause some genes to turn on and others to turn off. The biological repercussions of these alterations are not yet understood.

BOSTON — Two white-coated lab technicians, seated at work stations in a corner, are vastly outnumbered by the machines. Robotic arms calibrate liquids in microdrops. Small trays, with 96 tiny wells each, shuttle around the lab on magnetic tracks. Centrifuges whir. Gene sequencers hum.
The highly mechanized lab — operated by Ginkgo Bioworks, a fast-growing start-up in Boston — is an engine room of synthetic biology, an emerging field that applies the tools of engineering and computing to make entirely new organisms or genetically turbocharge existing ones.

Adam Bowen and James Monsees, by their own telling, set out to improve the lives of a billion people by getting them off cigarettes.
But somewhere on the path from fledgling start-up to Silicon Valley juggernaut, their company, Juul, went tragically off course. Instead of upending Big Tobacco and hastening the end of smoking, Juul’s flavored e-cigarettes became a popular on-ramp for a new generation of nicotine addicts.
Attracted by the candy fruit flavors and vibrant marketing, teenagers like Jackie Franklin found that Juul packed an undeniable rush of nicotine, which she increasingly craved. After becoming hooked in high school, she was vaping as many as three Juul pods a day.
