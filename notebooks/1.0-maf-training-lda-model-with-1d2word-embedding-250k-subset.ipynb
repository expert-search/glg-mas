    "Several different versions of LDA were tried as an alternative to the LDA approach. Most of the iterations were attempts to make it run faster. For this, a portion of the article was used (specifically the title plus a short 'intro', typically 30 words. Attempts to cluster the resulting vectors did not produce good results; we later found that it would have been worth creating vectors only for the most commonly occurring words, rather than for each and every word. This may well have produced better \n",
